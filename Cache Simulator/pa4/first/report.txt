The data structure I used within this assignment was a 2-D array. The array simulated the cache by having the rows represent the sets, and the columns representing the lines. Within each index, I stored a struct that would hold the fields of the valid tag, the tag of the address itself, and the last index of a valid index. I also observed that when using the prefetcher, the amount of hits went up by a lot as compared to the number of misses which went down. However, it also increased the number of memory reads. This is because whenever the prefetcher misses, another memory read is issued, which increases how many total reads will be issued in the program. However, because of the prefetcher, the hits increase since the next most likely called block is is already in the cache. Overall, this leads to an increased number of hits, a decreased number of misses, and an increased number of reads.
